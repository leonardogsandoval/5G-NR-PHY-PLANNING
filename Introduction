The rectangular function with a duration of T, produces a Fourier transfom  = T*sinc(fT), this makes that the first crossing zero would be with f=1/T, tha means that the next carrier can have its maximum at SCS=1/T

see https://www.nrexplained.com/basics/ofdm

taking this into account, the symbol duration depends on the SCS
